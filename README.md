**Computer Vision**

continuously improving since 2015 after completion of deliveries of 45
machines based on DE2-115 Boards to Indian Railways. This project was
meant to detect objects in x-ray images obtained in real time from x-ray
scanners. Though originally the project was for DE2--115 Boards only,
but as of now, the Anasim processor, the software and other related
IPCores can be ported to any FPGA platform and ASIC.
