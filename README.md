**Computer Vision**

Started in 2013, DE2-115 FPGA Board based computer vision project is
continuously improving since 2015 after completion of deliveries of 45
machines based on DE2-115 Boards to Indian Railways. This project was
meant to detect objects in x-ray images obtained in real time from x-ray
scanners. Though originally the project was for DE2–115 Boards only, but
as of now, the Anasim processor, the software and other related IPCores
can be ported to any FPGA platform and ASIC.

The project has several applications in the field of defence, robotics,
industrial and medical computer vision.
